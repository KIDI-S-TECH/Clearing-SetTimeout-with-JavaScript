#  Clearing SetTimeout with JavaScript 
To begin with, I want to start by thanking everyone for the massive review and love on my works. your reviews do motivate me to develop and solve more tremendous works with JavaScript and some other awaiting programming languages. however, lets get to the wonderful knowledge and experience I'm going to share with the community today.
 Futhermore,the following will explain and give you an indepth understanding and knowledge about this project and how to use it at your various places of work.

How to use and the purpose of this project:
1: This project was intensively developed with the motive of ensuring prevention and improvement of proactive security software for the protection of an organization infrastructure.

2:Before rolling on the real deal, an indepth knowledge of html,css and Javascript is needed to be able to understand how to clear settimeout funtion with Javascript because it's kinda tricky if this is your first time here.

3: First thing first, make sure you've created or will create a nice template on your html file to be able to fit in on this project.

4: After which, link your Js.file with your html file. then use an attribute selector to make it more easier for you to get your elements to your Js.file at once. as seen on my time.js file. moreover, if you're new to programming then you've nothing to worry about because I'll stick with you throughout this project or problem solving because it's a very tricky one to work on alone. however, this will automatically lead us to the 5th step.

5: this step is an easy one for everyone, so you've nothing to be worried about. after you must've selected the required element from your html file. then create a  constant variable by using the word "LET" and assign a value to it. remember assigning a value at this point depends on how and when you want the security protocol or the settimeout to execute on your program. as seen on my time.js, I used 200 as my value and it's applicable on your end if you wish.

6: step 6 is where a  reaquired function timer() was created. don't worry if you don't know how create a function in Javascript, you're 100% free to access and use my work template. on that note, the timer function will execute whenever the initial function is been called outside the gobal function. don't get afraid yet alright hahaha!. alright, A global function is a function that is defined outside of a class or struct and can be accessed from anywhere in the program. after which assign your input element.innerHTML = time.

7: in this step, you'll create another constant veriable  which will be assign to the  setinterval function to and set the time you want as a timer. it's usally caculated in sec which is 1000 = 1sec. haven't understood how to assign and store the setinterval function to a varibale which I named as timing on my time.js file.

8: The setTimeout is a function method which  perform the timeout task and clear the time you set on your initial variable as seen on my time.js mine was set as 200. and these can only be done once. 

9: on the next, create a settimeout function after or on the next line of your code and inside your function, use the key word "clearTimeout(timing)" to store the veriable you assign to the setInterval function which is "timing" on my end.
 
10: lastly, you can clear your timer by mutiplying the varibale time(value) which 200 * 1000(timer) to be able to iterate and excute its expected function at the right time. I presumed that we must've assimilated alot today.

Just a recap for quick understanding, to solve this problem you only need two responsive functions which are the setinterval function that take care of the timer while the settimeout function will be  responsible to execute any function for clearing of the time that's been assign by the programmer at the initial stage. 

furthermore, In reference to the development of a proactive security software that will be used to protect an organization infrastructure. however, this is where this problem solving or project will be  applied. for instance, If a cybersecurity analyst is given a task to develop a software that will helps to protect an organization from their potential threats, risks and vulnerabilities. the dveloper can apply this method by using setinterval function method to set a timer and the SetTimeout function to clear the time on the program that will execute the software functionality. this method can be a very effective and essential way in validating and creating a software that will protect the financial aspect of an organization by detecting and clearing any found threats or risksa nd vulnerabilities that can be harmful to the organization and prevent them from happening at the first place.

 By doing this, It'll protect the assets of an organization from been compromised of their the security standard and leaking of confidential informations that will lead to damage of the brand or company. Most importantly, It'll protect the company's reputation by making them meeting up to the regulatory policy in cyber security. 
Also, the last part of this algorithm deals with the EventListener in javascript. which will be attached soonest. do well to reach if experience any issue on your progress.
